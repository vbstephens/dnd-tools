# dnd-tools

This is a set of scripts for creating nice-looking spell cards, monster cards, and/or item cards for D&D 5E using LuaLaTeX. 

Much of the original data comes from [Open5E via GitHub](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e-api), and I use their basic format for JSON files, but most of the entries (particularly spell card descriptions) have been modified to make the formatting TeX-friendly. I have also added material from supplemental sources as needed. 

## Spell Cards

The spell cards are inspired by several DIY designs across the internet---but particularly [these](https://hardcodex.ru/)---with my own modifications. Generated cards are 2.5 in by 3.5 in, designed to be the same size as a standard playing card.

### Build

Spell card scripts live in the `spell-card-generator` directory. To generate a card set, run the `spell-cards.tex` file through LuaLaTeX, either from the command line or through your preferred IDE. 

The full list of spells, in JSON format, is in `spells.json`. To include additional spells, add them to `spells.json` in the prescribed format. To point the script to a different file, modify line 14 of `spell-cards.tex` with the appropriate file path.

Card sets are generated by class. To build a particular set of cards, modify the `\class{}` command at line 10 of `spell-cards.tex` with your desired class. For example: `\class{Paladin}` will generate spells cards for all the spells available to paladins. Alternatively, use `\class{All}` to generate spell cards for all the spells listed in `spells.json`; each card will note all the classes by which each spell can be used.

### Colors
Each class's cards have a different colored background. To customize, modify the appropriate line under the "colors" heading near the beginning of `spell-cards.sty`. I advise relatively dark colors so that the white text is easy to read.

### TO DO items

- (MAYBE) Generate card sets based on various filters (level, school, etc.) in addition to character class
- (MAYBE) Add a footer with source location (e.g. PHB p. xxx)
- (BUG) Spells that apply to a single class shouldn't generate with their class color instead of black background when using `\class{All}`. (Example: Animal Shapes)
- (QOL) Truncate description and refer to page number on cards with so much text that the font size is too small to read comfortably.

## Monster Cards

Monster card tools live in the `monster-card-generator` directory. These are still under construction.

## Item Cards

Item card tools live in the `item-card-generator` directory. These are still under construction.
