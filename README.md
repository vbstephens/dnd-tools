# dnd-tools

This is a set of scripts for creating nice-looking spell cards, monster cards, and/or item cards for D&D 5E using LuaLaTeX. 

Data, including spell lists, monster stats, and items, come from [Open5E via GitHub](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e-api). The content is unchanged, but I made formatting modifications throughout to make the JSON files TeX-friendly. Feel free to report any errors you find. Because the data requires manual formatting adjustments, it is not automatically updated if Open5E content is updated. I may or may not try to automate formatting changes at some point. Most recent manual data update: 8 January, 2023.

## Spell Cards

The spell cards are inspired by several DIY designs across the internet---but particularly [these](https://hardcodex.ru/)---with my own modifications.

### Build

Spell card scripts live in the `spell-card-generator` directory. To generate a card set, run the `spell-cards.tex` file through LuaLaTeX, either from the command line or through your preferred IDE. 

The full list of spells, in JSON format, is in `spells.json`. To include additional spells, add them to `spells.json` in the prescribed format. To point the script to a different file, modify line 14 of `spell-cards.tex` with the appropriate file path.

Card sets are generated by class. To build a particular set of cards, modify the `\class{}` command at line 10 of `spell-card.tex` with your desired class. For example: `\class{Paladin}` will generate spells cards for all the spells available to paladins. Alternatively, use `\class{All}` to generate spell cards for all the spells listed in `spells.json`; each card will note all the classes by which each spell can be used.

### Colors
Each class's cards have a different colored background. To customize, modify the appropriate line under the "colors" heading near the beginning of `spell-card.sty`. I advise relatively dark colors so that the white text is easy to read.

### Possible TO DO items

- Generate card sets based on various filters (level, school, etc.) in addition to character class
- Add a footer with source location (e.g. PHB p. xxx)

## Monster Cards

Monster card tools live in the `monster-card-generator` directory. These are still under construction.

## Item Cards

Item card tools live in the `item-card-generator` directory. These are still under construction.
